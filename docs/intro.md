Example PRObs system definitions
================================

This book shows an example of how a system can be modelled with PRObs.

This demo includes several use cases: loading and mapping sample datasets into the ontology, retrieving data points with their system context, retrieving inferred observations at aggregated object level, identifying provenance of observations, and more.

This work is part of the [UK FIRES](https://ukfires.org) project.
