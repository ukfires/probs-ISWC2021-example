Object definitions
==================

Here are just a few example object types which we might be interested in modelling.

```{system:object} Aggregates
:become_parent: true
```

```{system:object} CrushedStone
:label: Crushed stone
```

```{system:object} SandAndGravel
:label: Sand & Gravel
```

```{end-sub-objects}
```

```{figure} figures/Aggregates_Hierarchy.svg
:name: Aggregates Hierarchy
:width: 100%

Aggregates Hierarchy.
```

Note that these are "new" objects that we have created because they are interesting for our analysys.
We also call them _Reference Objects_.

[[Add query to retrieve them. Maybe also add query to retrieve all the objects.]]
